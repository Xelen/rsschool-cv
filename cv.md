### Professional Summary:
I embarked on my career as a designer, where I played a pivotal role in the creative process for a small advertising company.

With an impressive 15-year trajectory in this field, I've evolved into a versatile professional, equipped with a wealth of skills and knowledge.

While I currently possess a basic level of programming proficiency, I have a firm grasp of coding principles and a strong eagerness to advance my programming capabilities. I am committed to staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving web development landscape and excited about the potential for future growth in this dynamic field.

### Code example:
This jQuery code was employed in one of my projects for an e-commerce website. The code's purpose is to remove a block with the class '.selected-card' (which contains the results of selected product filter options) and then search for a block with the class '.group' on the page. Subsequently, it adds the '.selected-card' block before it.
```
var filterResult = $('.selected-card').remove();
$('.group').before(filterResult);
```
