This jQuery code was employed in one of my projects for an e-commerce website. The code's purpose is to remove a block with the class '.selected-card' (which contains the results of selected product filter options) and then search for a block with the class '.group' on the page. Subsequently, it adds the '.selected-card' block before it.
```
var filterResult = $('.selected-card').remove();
$('.group').before(filterResult);
```
